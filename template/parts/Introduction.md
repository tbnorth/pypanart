# Introduction
Yihui Xie's `knitr` [@Xie2014; @Xie2015; @Xie2016].

![A figure demonstrating the conversion of `.svg` sources to `.png` or
`.pdf` as appropriate.
The SVG part of this image is saved as img/demo_figure.svg.
build/html/img/demo_figure.png and build/tmp/img/demo_figure.pdf are
made by the img task. The background image is saved in the special
`base` folder, i.e. img/base/base_img_demo.png. PyPanArt will copy
images in folders other than `base` to build/html/img.
